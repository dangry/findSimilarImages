I created this because there's a lot of repeated images in my pc and I want to find and organize them. 


**TODO:**    
    
    - When there's only one image it fails as it can't iterate through
    - Tests
    - Image information and option to delete (moving to a folder)
    - Better image display
    - Use dotenv
    - Give path to process images and save processed data
    - Easier navigation (Next, previous)
